## ABSTRACT

### Motivation
Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection is critical for cancer treatment and prognostic evaluation. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based variant detection from circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) represents the state-of-the-art approach for MRD assessment. Crucially, MRD detection results must be stable, as fluctuations in detection performance can severely impact clinical decisions and therapeutic evaluations, yet maintaining stable detection remains challenging. Specifically, ctDNA samples exhibit substantial heterogeneity due to mixtures of normal DNA and multiple tumour subclones, leading to pronounced inter- and intra-sample variability. Consequently, the tools relying on fixed parameter configurations experience severe performance fluctuations across different genomic regions and samples. Although dividing genomic regions into heterogeneous subsets for separate optimisation can theoretically stabilise detection, manual parameter tuning is impractical due to numerous genomic intervals and highly coupled parameters across variant detection and filtering stages. Adaptive optimisation also faces significant challenges, including gradient-free objectives and unknown, dynamically changing constraints. 

### Results
In this study, we propose MRD-Agent, a novel variant detection tool designed specifically for MRD detection. MRD-Agent incorporates an iterative and self-adaptive optimisation framework capable of handling unknown objectives, varying constraints, and highly coupled parameters across stages. A key innovation of MRD-Agent is the integration of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based meta-model, trained on historical data to enable rapid parameter prediction. This significantly enhances computational efficiency and generalisation performance. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate MRD-Agent’s superior and stable performance, providing an efficient, reliable solution for MRD detection in clinical and high-throughput research applications.

## 4. Meta-model Training
We viewed parameter recommendation for each genomic region as distinct yet related "tasks". For each task, we extracted meta-features X (Supplementary table s3) capturing inter-sample heterogeneity from corresponding BAM files and combined these with the optimal parameter configurations y, thus forming a meta-dataset. The CNN-based meta-learning model was then trained on this dataset, explicitly learning the common mapping between meta-features and optimal parameters across tasks (Supplementary Methods.3)
```bash
python metamodel.py --features "metamodel/Supplementary Table3.xlsx" --labels "metamodel//Supplementary Table5_sorted.xlsx"
```

### Why an Agent is Needed to Balance Constrained Conditions in Variant Detection
We used MRD-Agent to conduct variant detection. MRD-Agent adopts a DQN framework to facilitate iterative parameter optimisation between the preliminary detection and filtering stages. By dynamically balancing the constraints on false negatives and false positives and integrating stepwise optimisation, MRD-Agent seeks to maximise the overall detection performance.

### Why a Meta-Model is Needed for Rapid Parameter Configuration
As previously described, MRD-Agent’s iterative interactions between the agent and ADMM module result in exponentially increased computational complexity. Moreover, due to the absence of an explicit loss function for gradient calculation, parameter optimisation relies solely on evaluation against a gold-standard reference, significantly restricting its applicability to new ctDNA samples.
, we trained a CNN-based meta-model using historical samples (X: Supplementary Table 3; y:  Supplementary Table 5), We conducted 10-fold cross-validation on 474 samples, using 427 for training and 47 for testing in each fold.
